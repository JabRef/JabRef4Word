# JabRef4Word
Fork of Docear4Word to offer similar functionality for JabRef and Word.

The goal is to port the plugin to work with [JabRef] instead of [Docear].
The [issues reported at Docear4Word] still have to be fixed in this fork.

The basic source has been extracted from the ZIP files provided at the [Docear4Word git repository].

Please note that the source files require Add-in Express 2010 files to recompile.
These cannot be included for legal reasons and you will need an Add-in Express developer licence.
